I am reading a book that explores how machine learning strategies can be implemented in various settings.
All code in this repository is derived from the text "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems. Third Edition" by Aurélien Géron.
All comments in the code are my own thoughts and analysis, as I examine the strategies used in each situation to understand each line of code
